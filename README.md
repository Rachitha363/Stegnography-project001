🕵️‍♀️ Steganography Project

A Python-based steganography tool that allows users to securely hide and extract secret messages within image files. This project demonstrates how digital data can be embedded inside images using Least Significant Bit (LSB) encoding, preserving both message integrity and image quality.

📌 Features
- 🔒 Hide secret text messages inside image files
- 🖼️ Supports PNG format for lossless embedding
- 📤 Extract hidden messages from stego-images
- ✅ Simple command-line interface or GUI-based usage
- 📁 Save stego-image as a new file without altering original image

🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- Pillow (`PIL`) – for image processing
- NumPy – for efficient array operations
